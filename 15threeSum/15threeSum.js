// Understanding 

// We want to iterate through an array and find sets of numbers that add up to 0
// we cannot 'double count' an index e.g. if arr[1] = -2, we could not use that twice with 4 to get a sum equal to 0 

// Methods and Ideas
// we should use pointers 
// we could...have a pointer at the beginning and the end
// and then slowly move the pointer at the end forward iterating through the midlle part of the array


// Pseudocode 
// create three pointers 
//
