// Understanding 
// The function needs to take the target and return the values that add up to the target 

// Methods 

// Pseduocode 
// find the index that is the last digit smaller than the target
// start adding the first value and see how big it is
// if too big - go to the next digit (left)
// 

// I could not think of a succinct way to solve this problem
