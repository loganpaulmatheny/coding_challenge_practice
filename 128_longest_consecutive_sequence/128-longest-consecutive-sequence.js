// Understanding 
// You have an unsorted array and you need to determine if the numbers are consecutive and then return the length of them

// Methods 
// I think the ruby next method would be really helpful


// Pseudocode 
// sort the array
// create a counter 
// loop through and increment the counter as long as the next element is 1 larger than the previous
// if it's not add the counter to the set and reset it to 0
// get the maximum number from the set
